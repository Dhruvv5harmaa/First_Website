    As I get time I'll update things in here !<br>
    <br>
    Some more facts about me. <br>
    I can solve rubix cube in less than a minute. <br>
    <br>
    I can solve mirror cube blindfolded.(without cheating)<br>
    <br>
    I love photography. <br>
    <br>
    I want to update my thoughts as well , but it would be not so good if I keep editing my <br>
    website for each single thought, so I have decided to provide my link to my blog  ,<br>
    incase you want to read my thoughts. <br>
    <br>
    I really loving to share my recent thoughts and learnings. <br>
    <a href="https://exploringshubh.blogspot.com/">My Blog</a><br>
    <br>
